# Battletanks!

### Play against a friend by aiming your turret (using the arrow keys) and firing with return. 
### Try out the different bullet types and attempt to destroy the opponent's tank.

#### Left/Right changes the angle of trajectory, up/down changes the velocity of the projectile. Try different types of bullets, but they cost money. Money can be gained by shooting the random bullet (which might not go exactly where you think it should). If you don't have enough money, the bullet will default to "random."

This is a project I made early on in my programming journey. It is a good example of me attempting to run before I could walk. 
Some day I would like to go back and create this project in a way that is much more efficient and runs more smoothly.
