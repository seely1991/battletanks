# Battletanks!

### Play against a friend by aiming your turret (using the arrow keys) and firing with return. 
### Try out the different bullet types and attempt to destroy the opponent's tank.

This is a project I made early on in my programming journey. It is a good example of me attempting to run before I could walk. 
Some day I would like to go back and create this project in a way that is much more efficient and runs more smoothly.
